# Description
This is a landing page for an eCommerce store I made a few years ago using WordPress and plugins. You can click on the logo or the blue buttons to navigate to the shop. The feature sections are all collapsible. They should highlight in green as you scroll by. You can also navigate to a feature section by using the corresponding header link. The Facebook link in the footer will go to the shop's actual Facebook page.
